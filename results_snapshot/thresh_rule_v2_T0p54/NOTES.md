Stage A VAL: acc 0.9669, bal 0.9276, macroF1 0.9299; tumor recall 0.9818; no_tumor recall 0.8734.

Stage A TEST: acc 0.7944, bal 0.8204, macroF1 0.7697; tumor recall 0.7647; no_tumor recall 0.8762.

Stage AB VAL: acc 0.9251, bal 0.9184, macroF1 0.9185; recall (glioma 0.933, men 0.867, no 0.873, pit 1.0).

Stage AB TEST: acc 0.6193, bal 0.6205, macroF1 0.5865; recall (glioma 0.22 collapse; men 0.670; no 0.876; pit 0.716). Conclusion: gate fixed; Stage B glioma generalization is now the bottleneck.
